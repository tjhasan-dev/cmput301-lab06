## Overview
This repository contains my implementation for CMPUT 301 Lab 6 Participation Exercise.

The purpose of this lab was to practice:
- Writing well documented Java classes
- Generating documentation using JavaDoc
- Working with Android Studio project structure
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Pushing code using terminal commands

--------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description
This project includes Java classes that model city data and manage collections of cities.  
The project also demonstrates proper JavaDoc usage and documentation generation.


---

## Features Implemented
- City class with attributes (name, population)
- CityList class to manage city objects
- JavaDoc comments for classes and methods
- Generated JavaDoc HTML documentation
- GitHub repository creation and management
- Merge conflict resolution in .gitignore

---

## JavaDoc Documentation
JavaDoc was generated using Android Studio tools.

Documentation location:
app/javadocs/index.html

To view:
1. Navigate to app/javadocs
2. Open index.html in a browser

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Java
- Android Studio
- Git
- GitHub
- JavaDoc
- Gradle

## How To Run Project
1. Open project in Android Studio  
2. Allow Gradle to sync  
3. Run using emulator or physical device  

---

## Testing
Testing was performed using:
- Manual testing
- Unit testing using CityListTest.java

---

## How JavaDoc Was Generated
From Android Studio:
Tools → Generate JavaDoc

Output directory:
app/javadocs

-------------------------

## Git Notes
- Repository created on GitHub
- Remote added using terminal
- Merge conflict in .gitignore resolved manually
- Project pushed successfully using Git terminal commands
